                    <h2> what is water cycle?</h2>
                    <h4>*The water cycle is the continuous movement of water on, above, and below the Earth's surface. It's a complex system that
                    involves many processes, including evaporation, condensation, precipitation, and surface runoff. The water cycle has no
                    beginning or end, and it greatly influences the climate and all life processes on the planet.</h4></article>

                    <aside><h3>Different stages of water cycle:-</h3>
                    <ol><p>
                        <li><strong>Evaporation</strong>:-is the process that changes liquid water to gaseous water (water vapor).</li>
                        <li><strong>sublimation</strong>:-Sublimation converts ice directly into water vapor, bypassing the liquid phase.</li>
                        <li><strong>precipitation</strong>:-Precipitation is water released from clouds in the form of rain, freezing rain, sleet, snow, or hail.</li>
                        <li><strong>condensation</strong>:-is the process where water vapor becomes liquid. It is the reverse action of evaporation</li>
                        <li><strong>infiltration</strong>:-is a part of the water cycle and occurs when water moves into the ground from the surface and begins to soak into the
                        soil and rock layers underneath.</li><p>

        <li>The water cycle's evaporative cooling effect helps regulate the Earth's temperature. Without it, the Earth's temperature
        would rise dramatically.</li>
